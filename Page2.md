Before you can decide which program best suits your needs and goals it's best to understand what an IDE does vs what a text editor does.

#### Text Editors:

> There are essentially two types of text editors. Basic and code specific text editors. An example of a basic text editor would be notepad on a windows computer. You can create code and build a website within notepad, however it lacks many useful features that a code specific text editor would provide. Notepad and similar programs on other operating systems are the barest of bones text editors and can make it difficult to catch errors as well as reduce coding efficiency. A coding specific text editor, such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) provides many more options for coding compared to something like notepad. Its provides Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS which increases how fast one would be able to code. VS Code also provides syntax highlighting built in making it easier to read your code as well as catch errors faster. In addition to all this VS code is a very popular text editor with many guides and support available.



#### IDE (Integrated Development Environment):

> Now that we talked a little bit about what text editors are and what they can do let's briefly discuss what an IDE is and how it differs from a text editor. While text editors edit and manage text, an IDE in a grouping of various softwares packaged into one product. It can edit text, manage files, compile code, and debug all inside the same program. While starting out with simple websites or lines of code an IDE might be a bit overkill as you may not need all these features. I *personally* only have experience using Adobe Dreamweaver, which I think is a great IDE for beginners as its how I learned. Dreamweaver is expensive though and compared to most great text editors, which are free maybe not be the best choice starting out. In the end it all comes down to personal preference and what you feel most comfortable using. Good luck in the search for what program fits you the best!
