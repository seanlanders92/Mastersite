# How to Create a Local Website Repository:

> If you read the post about text editors and decided to use VS Code then this is the next step in your journey to effectively creating a website. The first step would be to navigate to your repository on GitHub and then find the green clone button. Click that to receive a link which you should then copy. Open your command prompt and type git clone *(link from GitHub)*. Navigate to the folder containing your website project file using a combination of the ls -la commands and the cd commands. Once in the folder use the git add *(projectfilename)* command to add this file to the queue. Once you make some local changes in VS Code to the project file you will want to sync them with what is in GitHub. You can check the status of a file by using the git status command. Once you know a change needs to be made you can use the git commit -m "insert notes" command followed by the git push origin master command to sync the updated file with what is on GitHub. When dealing with multiple files in a project you can use the git add --all command to que them all for committing.
